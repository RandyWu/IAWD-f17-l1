Web Programming Week 5:

declaring a function in javascrit:

function functionName (arguments) {
    code block;
}

arguments are just placeholder names.

<example>
function addition(x,y){
    return x + y
}

function fullName (str1, str2) {
    console.log(str1 + " " + str2);
}
</example>

functions are not run until they are called. So to run addition you need to call it:
<example> {
addition(1,2)
</example>

It is the best practice to define a function before you use it. As java reads everything top down.

void functions - a function that doesn't return anything. The fullName function above is a void function.

A non void function would be the addition function above.

Variables declared inside a function are scoped to the function.
<example>
var foo = 1
console.log(foo)      //Will show 1
function hello () {
    foo = 2;
    console.log(foo); //Will show 2
}
console.log(foo)      //Will show 1
</example>


You can also declare functions as variables.
<example>
var sum = function(x,y){
    return x + y
}

var result = sum(10,5);

console.dir('The sum of 10 and 5 is `${result}`')    //The `${}` is just a formatter. You have to use ` ` and then ${} in between
</example>
